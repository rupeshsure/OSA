# ABSTRACT
Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a rather prevalent condition. Adult men are affected by
OSA at a rate of 14%, whereas adult women are affected at a rate of 5%. Due to upper airway
collapse, sleep fragmentation, and/or oxygen desaturation, patients with OSA experience occasional
cessation or reduction of breathing during sleep, resulting in non-restorative sleep, excessive daytime
drowsiness, and weariness.
